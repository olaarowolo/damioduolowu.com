        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          I am Dami Oduolowu (@damioduolowu), a second-year doctoral student at the J-school. My research focus is on media sociology, with a particular emphasis on digital journalism. I am studying the dynamics of citizen journalism practices and their implications for journalism and society.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am from Lagos, Nigeria, where I worked as a senior reporter for the BBC, covering youth-related stories in West Africa. Last summer, I contributed to <a href="YOUR_KOMU_URL">@komunews</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Currently, I serve as the Director of Public Relations and Communications for the Graduate Professional Council (GPC). Additionally, I am the President of the University of Missouri's chapter of the Society of Professional Journalists (SPJ).
